We're already less-inclined at making babies. Your military force is shrinking and your defence budget is expanding further to unmanned weaponry. Lots of developed nations refuse to acknowledge the fact that : They're always relying on the uneducated to gain economic value, while going on the same cycle of infrastructure development as if we're still a developing country. This puts your educated populace at a loss : The people don't know what they can do for the country using what they'd learnt throughout the early parts of their lives. This is why running jokes like ""studying engineering degrees just to work in economics"" exist. Upskilling initiatives is just a subtle way mask the truth that our economy is forced to meet the competitive demands of the global market. Developing nations are on the rise learning from us, but there's barely much we can learn from them. 

We're not moving forward either. Employers loathe the WFH culture as much as the zi char auntie prefers cash over cashless. WFH was never about productivity, it's all about integrating our internet infrastructure into a working economy. Cashless culture already did so, and their blunders over the years opens up opportunities to expand and improve on the IT sector. To think that we have the best internet infrastructure in SEA, yet the most we use 5G for is for TikTok, Reddit comments(like mine right here), YouTube, Netflix etc."

In the late 1980s, the government said that importing foreign workers to generate economic growth was unsustainable and had ""enormous social and economic costs"". In fact, LHL himself in 1989 warned of the danger of having too many foreign workers.

>He said he would rather have a slower growth rate which is sustainable for Singapore's mature economy than a rapid one which could lead to ""overheating"".

>Having foreign workers also does not strengthen Singapore's economic structure or encourage companies to upgrade to higher value-added activities. Neither would it result in better jobs for Singaporeans.

Few things Singapore can make NS as optional, but should give priority to who has done the NS in certain sectors like how USA does. In that way, student who more confident, can skip the NS. It will save their time, and unnecessary debate as well.  


Looking at the growth, it can give better health care, a lot of developing countries even does better. You cant make wait some for med test/scans. It's funny for a developed nation.  


Its very difficult to integrate a grown up people to the society, when there is no transparent-well defined requisite PR system. As we grow up we become more rigid. A grown up educated/competent person cant be blind about his/her future. So the new system of work pass even cant attract real talent to Singapore.  
If the PR system need to be kept secret, Singapore should take initiative more on getting student based on merit and groom them. Youngers integrate better than a grown up person.

It's the class divide. Indians from the south tend to come here as blue collars. They are generally tamil-speaking folk who can integrate well in sg. Many of them don't come from privileged backgrounds or affluent family lineages that afford them a professional qualification. Singapore practically doesn't want any blue collar immigration at all.

Indians with professional qualifications come from elsewhere, and generally are not tamil-speaking, and (imo) integrate less well in sg. They also tend to come from more privileged and affluent backgrounds that afforded them that education, and in our current world, tech workers are in massive demand. Singapore loves white-collar immigration!

Singapore does immigration on ""merit"" - which means blue-collar jobs basically don't count, and tech workers in higher paying jobs have the red carpet. So for south asian immigration, sg wants the people who are harder to integrate with, because economic concerns come first. 

No one wants to admit it but blue-collar workers also contribute a lot, but admitting they have merit would challenge the status quo of calling them ""unskilled"" and their low pay."

Born a prince of the Cherusci tribe, Arminius was part of the Roman-friendly faction of the tribe. He learned Latin and served in the Roman military, which gained him Roman citizenship, and the rank of eques. After serving with distinction in the Great Illyrian Revolt, he was sent to Germania to aid the local governor Publius Quinctilius Varus in completing the Roman conquest of the Germanic tribes.

Clearly that's a problem now, because everyone needs to be kind of a manager or leader and doer to have any hope of surviving in a society that is labour light.

The unfortunate fact is that esp for the O=others, the bar to get PR has become extremely high which means you might have to be a seasoned professional with years of demonstrated specialised experience that Singapore govt deemed valuable, in order to have a shot of PR. Don't forget that for the O, there will also be others who married Singaporean and once they produce another Singaporean esp if they are males, they are likely to take up another O quota.

For some reason, it's regarded as conspiratorial to suggest that PAP benefits politically from the FT policy. I recently heard from a friend of mine who does research on public policy (won't rat on him) that around the world, voter loyalty from new citizens can last up to 20 years. 20 years! Think of the impact on the political landscape. 

Assuming that every year we get 20k new local borns and 12k new foreigners, and around 10k of the foreigners vote for PAP. On that account alone, the opposition has to get nearly 15k --- around 3/4 of the local borns in order to break even.

Whatâ€™s your proof a long term PR whoâ€™s been living in a country for a very long time contributes less than new citizens? Some new citizens immediately go and convert right when they can. In western countries itâ€™s fixed. They have SET regulations in place. For eg in the largest immigration nation in the world USA, after you are PR for 5 years and physically present in the country for 30 months as PR, you are eligible to be citizen and if you donâ€™t have a criminal record you apply you get it without issue. SG doesnâ€™t release anything. They want to retain control and they can administer as they wish behind the scenes, if there is no fixed regulation by law. Immigrants just apply like playing tikam tikam no one knows thereâ€™s no timeline no formula no rules nothing released in black and white. Some people especially those from countries with a very poor passport for travel and very very poor standard of living (China, India, Myanmar) apply for citizenship extremely fast.

Others (Malaysians) take very long, I know Malaysians who have lived and worked in Singapore for decades and still not applied for naturalization as the thought of returning for retirement is greater as Malaysia is nearest to SG and with the closest culture. Standard of living of Malaysia and SG donâ€™t differ much also further demotivating Malaysians from giving up their passport. Others like yellow raced Indonesians rarely ever convert especially males as they need to be Indonesian citizens to inherit Indonesian business and real estate from their wealthy family.

The jump from PR to new citizenship is not some magic jump whereby once the person jumps, suddenly the contribution increases. Thereâ€™s no such increase seen or documented. Immigrants are more motivated by personal circumstances like how shitty their birth country is, that determines whether they apply for naturalization and give up their birth passport.

Such data is used to understand and manage social frictions, social trends and do social engineering. Thatâ€™s why governments collect foreign born vs local born, and transparent governments RELEASE that."

Chinese so mix well with Chinese?  No!  Indians from different regions can be very (culturally) different.  I met an Indian from the Northeast of India and he insists he is not at all like other Indians from the North.  Sri Lankans may look the same to us but they hate to be associated with the Indians.  

The early Chinese and Indians (and Europeans) who came intermingled with the Malays and thus, we have Peranakan and Eurasian communities too.  *Thatâ€™s the Singaporean core.*  And that has been lost with the kinds of foreigners accepted as long term PRs and worse, new citizens.  Have you seen the new Indian citizens?  They couldnâ€™t be more culturally different from the local Indians (some even look down at the latter.) Similarly with the PRC new citizens, but at least in terms of Mandarin, food and work ethic, can still gel a bit with local Chinese.  But their inability (or refusal to try) to speak English will be a problem.

Regardless of race, Govt should choose people who actually have love and pride in Singapore, not people who come in thinking they are some elite members of a club (like someone commented elsewhere on this thread) and start to look down on locals who may be PHV drivers etc.   

If it were up to me, I would not allow in anyone who doesnâ€™t appreciate Singapore and what makes it special beyond the low taxes - like HDB, hawker food, etc.

TLDR:  we have to stop looking at race in such simple terms.  I think that has created a lot of problems for assimilation."
llb4goi,t3_1f7yc6c,,15,1725372950,03/09/2024 22:15,"TLDR: agreed brother with some caveats

long rant/GP essay:

Singapore is the richest tropical country in the world by GDP per capita. Our native born population cannot sustain that or the high quality of living we enjoy simply because essential sectors of our economy are high-touch and very competitive.   

We have a very pragmatic balance between Western style and Gulf countriesâ€™ immigration models. And our legislators are quick to recalibrate policies due to their parliamentary majority and will to keep it that way.

e.g. Person X was born and raised in Country A. They are educated, skilled and qualify for certain category of jobs. Country A has spent its resources in Person X from birth.

Country Z attracts Person X to work there due to better opportunities, higher salary, good QoL, personal safety, cosmopolitan vibes, low taxes, whatever. Country Z might also have low birth rates and is keen on finding potential citizens to prevent population drop or distorting existing racial/ethnic demographics.

Country Z gets Tax Revenue from Person X without having had to spend anything on them vs a citizen. The employer gets a dedicated worker who will be willing to work harder than locals and possibly more skilled or possess niche skills.

Country A also benefits from remittances, investments etc by Person X to their home country so its a win win for both governments.

Person X might also be ok with borderline exploitation to maintain their work visa and qualify for permanent residency eventually. 

Person X will actively seek other Countries to immigrate to if Country Z doesnâ€™t provide an eventual pathway to residency or citizenship. Or simply because top talent is highly mobile and relocates to where the key jobs are, either within their company or across their industry. Geography is irrelevant when you are super rich or really good at your job. 

Above is for PMETs. 

Blue collar immigrants are also highly skilled but there is an oversupply there and they are not educated enough for serious clout. They are ok to earn a living in tough conditions and save enough for their fam back home. Way more than they could ever do in their home country.

Economically Singaporeâ€™s model is great for the governmentâ€™s top line and for its people.

However the anti-immigration sentiment is cultural, like how it is all over the world. Regular people dont care about macroeconomics, geopolitics etc.

So even though one of the (if not THE) largest group of PMET class of foreigners and PRs in SG are Mâ€™sian Chinese and their dependents, that is not an issue because they are culturally compatible with SG demographics and culture. 

The issue arises when â€œapunehnehsâ€ or â€œnationalities who make up the bulk of our domestic helpersâ€ drive continental cars, stay in expensive condos and live a life which throws local racial dynamics off balance. And ofcourse, proper western â€œexpatsâ€ are off limits; they have always enjoyed extreme privilege in Singapore. 

e.g. DYK American citizens are [exempt from ABSD](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/stamp-duty/for-property/appeals-refunds-reliefs-and-remissions/common-stamp-duty-remissions-and-reliefs-for-property/foreigners-eligible-for-absd-remission-under-free-trade-agreements-(ftas)) (among other select countries) and American military personnel and their support staff deployed in Singapore are exempted from COE? 

New immigrants also donâ€™t help their cause by often grating on local sensibilities and importing their cultural practices, prejudices and biases - this has become worse because of fast internet and cheap flights, because the pressure to assimilate isnâ€™t really there.

All in all, I do see most foreigners really making an effort to fit in and most Singaporeans being very gracious hosts. Ofcourse there will be xenophobes and racists on all sides but hope they can have enough meaningful interactions with each other to get over the worst of their biases.

Other than MRT, this is the other big good thing that we remember Ong Teng Cheong for.

The issue is that a lot of Singaporeans are content with their current life.  In a larger country that's fine; they can retire to the countryside.  The equivalent for SG is retiring to a third tier city like KL (Bangkok/Jakarta would be second tier) or going out to Kelantan.  

But there's no way for these people who are content with life as it is right now to do so without giving up all the things that make them content, like safety, healthcare and jobs.  So there will always be discontented people in SG who are deeply frustrated with the pace of life and yet have nowhere to go.  And immigration is a convenient thing to complain about because by default in Singapore, all immigrants are foreign (vs e.g. Penang people moving to KL)."

Most ppl just want a better life and it is not easy to adapt. If things were going well in their own country, people won't leave.

We live in a globalized world, immigration affects a lot of places around the world and we are not the only place that faces this issue. Usually people only immigrate to places that are better off.

I'm personally not in favour of letting all rich people to come in. These people have more options than most to just jump to the next place. There has to be some ideas to stop people from doing this.

Bro you've been parroting this toothless rhetoric since more than 10 years ago. Has it worked?

From 2012:
>""Pick up Singapore customs, lifestyles, norms, social rules,"" he urged the new citizens. ""Be conscious that this is something which you need to do. And watch out also for the little cultural differences which I'm sure there will still be. Know about them, and try to bridge them.""

First off, Singapore benefitted from the rise of China, as an alternative gateway into the China market to Hong Kong. However, we all know that China's relations around the world are getting strained, and in fact many MNCs have pulled out of the China market into neighbouring Asian countries instead.


Second, we know from Covid, that foreigners indeed take up most of the top positions. When Singapore reopened after Covid, there was an employees' market available which was caused by the void left behind by foreigners who had fled Singapore to return to their home countries.


Third, what other benefits do foreign firms really get by setting up part of their business in Singapore? Singapore has no natural resources, labor is much more expensive than other parts of the world, and these firms need foreigner talent instead of Singaporeans to fill their positions. So why even bother setting up in Singapore in the first place? How did Singapore even get a high GDP growth last year? Seems to me that higher government spending is artifically propping up the economy, similar to what Biden was doing in the US in his last months in office. Is that why the government wants to collect even higher tax revenues? To keep spending to maintain this economic growth? And why the government actually refuses to do anything else but monitor public housing prices?"

Article keywords: citizens, Lee, world, people, society

The mood of this article is: Estatic (sentiment value of 0.43)

SINGAPORE: New citizens enrich Singapore and invigorate its economy â€œin ways beyond what numbers can showâ€, said Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday (Mar 9).

Speaking at the Teck Ghee citizenship ceremony at Nanyang Polytechnic, Mr Lee said new arrivals bring fresh experiences, diverse perspectives and global connections.

This helps Singapore to plug into the world and thrive as a regional hub and a global node.

â€œThis is how cities like London, New York or Shanghai become great centres of culture and prosperity. They attract enterprising and adventurous people from all over the world to go there, to live and work.

â€œAnd the steady infusion of new arrivals sharpens them, sparks cross-fertilisation of ideas and cultures, and creates an environment of constant innovation and enterprise,â€ he said.

Recalling his visit to Googleâ€™s headquarters in Silicon Valley two years ago, Mr Lee noted that most of the presenters he met had grandparents who hailed from all around the world.

â€œThat is Americaâ€™s enormous advantage â€“ it draws top talent from every continent, and therefore it can innovate and stay ahead,â€ he said, adding that Singapore must always be open to ideas and talent from around the world.

â€œThis is how we became a shining red dot. Because our ancestors came here from many lands, made this their home, and built up this country. And is what we must continue to do, to shine even brighter in future â€“ not just for our own sakes, but for our children and grandchildren too.â€

MEASURED AND BALANCED

The Singapore government is â€œkeenly awareâ€ of the need to handle immigration and integration sensitively, especially as the inflows are not small either, said Mr Lee.

Every year, there are about 30,000 citizen babies born and Singapore takes in about 22,000 new citizens.

â€œEven dragon year âˆ’ last year âˆ’ still not quite 30,000 citizen babies born. So we do need to bring in more people, more talent, more contributions,â€ he said.

It is therefore crucial for Singapore to manage its immigration inflows carefully by keeping it measured and balanced, said Mr Lee. It is also important to pay close attention to relations and harmony between different ethnic groups and people who are here, and take in people who can fit in and add to society.

He highlighted various ways Singapore integrates its new residents.

All of them undergo the Singapore Citizenship Journey prior to obtaining their citizenship. The Integration and Naturalisation Champions from the Peopleâ€™s Association also run programmes to welcome and integrate new citizens into their communities.

â€œI hope now that you have become citizens, you will participate wholeheartedly in society, and make the effort to integrate,â€ he told the audience.

â€œLearn our values and cultural norms, get involved and contribute actively to your communities.â€

""OUR SINGAPORE TEAM""

Mr Lee said other Singaporeans must play their part too, such as by making friends with the new arrivals who may be neighbours, colleagues or schoolmates.

He also encouraged Singaporeans to be â€œbig-heartedâ€ and welcome new citizens as valuable members of â€œour Singapore teamâ€.

â€œTo help new citizens to fit in âˆ’ to feel at home here, to pick up how our society works, and how we can live harmoniously together. And to firmly reject those who play up nativist and xenophobic sentiments for political gain, which will do great harm to our society.â€

Rounding up his address, Mr Lee emphasised how Singaporeâ€™s success has always been built on its people â€“ those who came earlier from distant lands, their children born here, and those who continue to join the country every year from all over the world.

â€œAs long as we open our hearts and minds, we can together build a nation that remains vibrant, cohesive, and full of opportunity for those who call it home.â€

mguj0u2,t3_1j70rfe,kopibot,7,1741526283,09/03/2025 21:18,"Frankly, it's tiring to comment on these issues. What a waste of my time and energy. I don't even know why I bother at this point when I have other things to work on.

When these leaders talk about unity among the citizenry, of course they are making a valid point... but the way we exploit that unity to deliver the best outcomes for our people relative to the rest of the world population? It's poorly done.

Singapore, like other open countries, are exposed to a globalized workforce. That means the ultimate form of job security for locals has to be a world-class local workforce - not 100%, obviously, but let's say 70% of locals. If we played our cards extremely carefully with great leadership and high motivation from everyone, we could have made it work.

What the government has done instead is, ""We'll limit the number of foreign workers who can come here by raising the minimum required salaries. Meanwhile, here's skillsfuture and a few of these other programs."" This is enough for the average worker to keep pace with skills inflation. That's right; after graduating from school where grades inflation is a phenomenon, workers now have to contend with skills inflation that has been made even more challenging by AI disruptions. But to have job security by being world-class? That entails being overcompensating for skills inflation, and these measures are very far from enough to achieve that for most people. The government leaders' default response at this point is to either surrender in practical terms (""we just have to keep trying with existing measures (even though we know they don't really work)"") or to taichi the problem to individuals (""it's your responsibility to upskill yourself""). This is like saying the ordinary cannot become extraordinary because they didn't try hard enough... which is correct! But imo that's pedestrian thinking, and good leaders would rise above that by finding all sorts of ways to augment individual efforts.

The other day, I saw someone talking in another thread about how any university major is valid as long as you have ""realistic expectations"". Yeah, right. What are the odds that you could enter the jobs market knowing you will be well sought after as a graduate of, say, English literature, if you're not a nepo baby or the next JK Rowling? That the young can continue to spout this kind of naive BS in today's economy is a reflection of a long broken information ecosystem which I have been sounding out for quite some time now. This is the kind of talk that might have passed muster in 2015, not 2025. The sand is shifting beneath people's feet and the leaders, themselves unsure of what moves to make next, default to some token measures that don't really address the crux of the issues. I'm not sure LKY would have done better but I can say for certain the current gen of leaders are super lost. I think there is also a fundamentally cynical distrust in overempowering locals who might then leave Singapore. Honestly kinda sad when I think about it.

Some locals, especially the xenophobes and the white collar managerial types, also need to take a good hard look at themselves. I know of Chinese expats who have only learnt English four years ago. Four years, and they speak better English than some of our locals. There is no excuse for laziness; if people don't want to own up to the fact that they're not trying hard enough to stay relevant, then they better pray that some kind of AGI utopia is on the horizon."

If the infrastructure is not able to accommodate the growing population, it can lead to overcrowding and lower quality of services for both new and existing citizens.
2. **Job Market Competition**: An influx of new citizens might create greater competition for **jobs**, especially in a highly competitive economy like Singaporeâ€™s. This could potentially affect local workers, particularly those who may already be facing challenges in securing employment due to factors like experience, qualifications, or age.
3. **Cultural Integration Issues**: While cultural diversity can be enriching, it can also pose challenges in terms of integration. If new citizens are unable to assimilate or respect local customs and norms, it may lead to social friction or a sense of **alienation** within communities.
4. **Wage Suppression**: An increase in the labor force, especially if new citizens are willing to work for lower wages, can sometimes lead to **wage suppression**, particularly in lower-income sectors. This could negatively impact the livelihoods of local workers who rely on stable wages to meet their living costs.
5. **Erosion of National Identity**: Some may argue that rapid immigration could lead to a **dilution of Singaporeâ€™s national identity.** They may believe that too many new citizens, especially those who may not embrace local traditions, could alter the unique cultural fabric that makes Singapore what it is.

As a foreigner (who will never be allowed to call this country a home), can I ask for some male answers to the following:

If you came to Germany and for reasons I cannot fathom liked the culture, language (well, obviously that one's beautiful!) and food, you found friends and wanted to stay. How would you feel about getting a clear-cut path to make that happen? As in, ""do X, Y, Z and you can stay indefinitely, citizenship requires you to do Foo"". Do you appreciate that this is an option? Maybe not Germany (I can relate), but Spain, Portugal, England, heck even Switzerland.

Now, I don't want to claim that military service is the same across countries, but I did have to serve in Germany. No jungle drills involved, but ask me about digging a hole in frozen ground to put up a sad joke of a tent for the night, a tent that frost turned hard enough so that you could knock on it like wood.

Should I, using similar arguments, consider everyone who wants to immigrate to my country with a penis a slacker and a leech?

Israel, a country that is probably VERY similar to SG in terms of NS (let's ignore the ""males only"" part for now) felt more friendly to foreigners making a home there than SG does in the time I flew there for work and lived there.

Please look a bit beyond this island. NS is a local issue (compensation, gender issues). Foreigners didn't fuck this up and cannot fix this, and if they ever would try to make a home in Singapore (good luck. hahahahaha) they most likely aren't snickering that they made it past NS. You're blaming the wrong people. You're barking up the wrong tree.

(I know there will be ""but we don't have the space Germany or Israel has"" arguments. But that's completely irrelevant to the NS/serving the country debate.)"
mgu1bbh,t1_mgt5tir,LeatherTanker,109,1741517029,09/03/2025 18:43,"I think the open-leg metaphor describes us very well. The gov is like the husband, the country the wife. 

A good relationship is when both partners respect and support each other, whether you can afford to eat durians or peanuts after dinner. They build a healthy, strong relationship through mutual understanding and compromise. Even when they are not in the best shape, they are able to make the best of what they have and still find happiness.

What we have now is, the husband is like a pimp, the wife his whore. He lets unmentionable number of men in her, while he collects massive amount of earnings off her. What the men are allowed to do to her depends on how much they are willing to pay.

He finds excuses to justify his causes for allowing this. They live in a faÃ§ade of happiness covered by dirty wealth. He convinces himself he's noble, because strange men leave happy, and he donates to charitable causes with that money. Just like how scammers convinced themselves that they create thousands of jobs, in the fight of trying to stop them.

The wife feels abused, betrayed and used, while getting only a fraction of her earnings. She is powerless to do anything because her husband yields too much power. 

There's a ray of light somewhere, when some men and women tried to stand up against him, but he never fails to find ways to put them down, no matter how despicable the methods are.

Perhaps the husband would change for the better, or someone finally overpowers him. The wife can only hope, that one day when she wakes, some kind of miracle has been bestowed upon her."

The feminists here are fine with 6 months of alternative service but not the current scheme men go through --- I wonder why.


Back when most of the workforce served (i.e. when local men made up the bulk of workers), it meant that the playing field was level. Your reservist commitments didn't affect you relative to others, since they were likely to have the same. With women entering the workforce *and* the flood of foreigners, NS commitments have become an original sin felt by a fraction of the workforce. It is not unheard of that HR personnel here are completely unaware of how to process SAF100s (the official notification for reservist call-ups). You think you'd see that in Israel?

As for your hypothetical argument ""everyone ... a leech"": Yes. If Germany had 28% of the new population serving 2 years with reservist with little to no recognition, then yes, that characterization would be quite apt. I'm willing to bet there would be a change in government before it got to that stage.Â 


Edit: I got the allowance for German conscripts wrong. But my point still stands.


Edit 2: In case you were wondering, my personal position is a 3-5% income and capital gains (the latter is trickier) tax on defense that *every* resident pays. Only those who have served, man, woman, foreigner, disabled, whatever, would be exempted. The specific numbers should be modified based on the military's needs, but ought to be of that order of magnitude, 3-5% being roughly the percentage of working years sacrificed for service."

Addressing points at a time: Your Wikipedia research is unfortunately not very helpful: Germany stopped enforcing conscription (it's kinda a German 377A before that one got repealed here) in steps. I served for a year, which of course is still different from NS.

Your point about the government is quite on point - DE just had elections and basically one in five voted for Nazis. Well-spoken, ""we're just looking out for our people"" Nazis. To make my position clear: I'm against those in my home country and anywhere else and think immigration is important and useful in general (if done right. Now this is where we can debate for hours I guess). So I'm not trying to be two-faced about this.

Finally, your suggestion. It's .. interesting. Personally it seems too much, but I have a hard time doing the math right now. 3-5% *for life* is a lot of money and also causes other issues. Your bunk mate works at McD and saves the (tiny) amount there. You are at McKinsey and save a metric ton of money. You both literally did the same service. Doesn't seem fair in different ways then? You're now saying ""bad luck, you did serve the country exactly like I did, but didn't find a better job so .. my contribution is valued a lot higher""

Edit: Adding my own research it seems that NS allowance is as high or higher compared to what I got (again, not apples to apples, different currencies, living costs, cultures etc)."

Regarding taxes. The real tax from NS is *time*. Allowance really doesn't matter since NS does not give you working experience. I will forever be 2 years behind my female peers, simply because of the genetic lottery. And that's why any exemption from taxes due to NS should be *percentage* based, not in absolute value. As for the numbers, if I assume 40 years of full time work, 2 years of that is around 5%, and that's where my proposed percentage comes from.Â 


Does it mean the rich get it better, or at least have more options? Sure. They can more likely ""pay"" their way out.

Singaporean Chinese culture could be potentially consumed or integrated into our Malay or Indian populations. e.g. Quite common to have halal seafood restaurants, English signs in Chinese shops and menus. But these â€œChina Chineseâ€ cultural imports make zero effort at catering to our Malay and Indian populations. Their shops are entirely in Chinese and staff exclusively speak Chinese.

If this is not put in check, I fear the day our Malay and Indian brothers feel alienated within their home country. Singapore will be much less stable"

Actually it depends on which angle on how you look towards these prcs.
Just take mine as example:

was walking towards the local hawker centre at 8.30pm. Local food stores preparing to close. Sure 
will be turned down by local aunties/uncles. Wheareas next door, selling fish soup steamboat. Blasting loud Chinese music but still willing to sell food at that hour. Service is fast, prc lady was polite. Gave us good quality steamboat for $28 filled to the bream, with lots of meat until my big-sized boyfriend and me cant finish, soup cooked almost same as local taste.

With better service like this, I think I would prefer going into these kind of shops that prcs can replicate local taste to get my money worth as a customer. Not really all sell malatang or grilled fish.  
Somemore a few also quite hardworking. And Btw only respect those prcs that assimilate into our culture. For me I can just close one eye of their accent even I canâ€™t understand their Chinese at all, as long as they know customer service."

1, Be it Xiaohongshu, tiktok, douyin, untimately it comes down to user preference, the likewise can be said for IG and facebook. brainwashed by xxx ideology and mainstream narrative video is kinda bs if you think about it, all the content you see are made by users/influencer or just every day tom dick harry. and even if it is really by official government or media outlet it is very easy to tell and straight forward. also also all social media have algorithm calculated recommendation and there is always options and ways to tell the said algorithms on the platform that you don't want to see or want to see less of x type of content. if you are not able to do even that you are part of the ""easily brainwashed"" people you are referring to.

2, Money is king, though not an expert on the matter, China being a top manufacturing and export nation is able to keep their price low and competitive, it is also note worthy that Chinese products are new and fresh additions to the sames old snacks we have had for god knows how long. (same reason as why there is more and more donki and korean minimarts opening but don't hear people complaining about it huh) imported goods from american/european countries are normally wayy more expensive prime energy drink and mr beast chocolate as example. If a few walmarts open locally im sure they will have their patrons, but ultimately its down to Singaporeans to show their opinion with their wallet.

3, China is starting to make better and better movie no? isn't more movie better? I don't hear people crying over seeing too much Avenger movie posters too, if the show is good why care where its from? I have colleagues who watch French, Indian, Thai movies too if that means anything.

4, Same as point 2 and 3, more options = better, people show support with wallet, no demand no supply. No shit if you criticize x country x country people will defend it, just look at sg and msia LOLOLOL.

5, Don't know much about this to give opinion but most likely is because China is advancing forward economically and technologically at a great pace, and is probably not just on this 2 media outlet.

6, Poor human rights or not, visit for yourself and see. Enemy of the enemy is friend so naturally China support Russia."
